Finally, we'll touch on some areas where even the best current implementations still fall short, and where things could go in the future.","socialImage":"/media/sarah.png"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-DEC","categorySlug":"/category/panel/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"“Accessibility is too hard” - Developer Edition","subtitle":"Panel","date":"2019-12-13","description":"In this panel, we’ll dig into people’s misconceptions about the difficulty of accessibility as well as some of the ways that accessibility is genuinely difficult.
