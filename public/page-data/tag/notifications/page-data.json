They can be intimidating when starting out, and frustrating for those who regularly deal with them. Do you really need a live region for that combobox? How do you make toast notifications noticeable for someone using screen magnification? Why does this one error message refuse to work with VoiceOver, even though it's fine with NVDA?

Finally, we'll touch on some areas where even the best current implementations still fall short, and where things could go in the future.","socialImage":"/media/sarah.png"}}}]},"file":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/b7e0ab35174517513faa46e0309ac69d/32198/mike.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Notifications","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":3,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/notifications","nextPagePath":"/tag/notifications/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","2644362409","401334301"]}
