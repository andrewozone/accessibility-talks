In Sara's time at Code and Theory, she has seen an accessibility awakening with not internally but also with clients. Accessibility deliverables are a clear value-add proposition to our clients, including creative technology and technical strategy integrations. Sara will be discussing how she has built an actionable awareness over multiple teams about accessible deliverables - from answering RFPs through QA and final launch. Sara will also be discussing the range of needs her clients are requesting when they’re building their digital products. Finally, Sara will be discussing current needs within the agency regarding scaling skillsets, capacity planning, and follow-the-sun development/test strategy.","category":"Event","title":"Accessibility in the Modern Digital Agency","subtitle":"Sara Tabor","socialImage":"/media/sara.jpg"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/event/","slug":"/posts/2019-AUG"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-08-20","description":"When we develop a new web application, we often put a lot of work on the design, on making it beautiful and usable. In other words, we want our web app to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for the user. But a lot of times we don’t think about the user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments. Adrián will show us some testing tools, libraries, and techniques to increase the a11y test coverage of our code with a simple React application example.","category":"Event","title":"Accessibility in the Modern Digital Agency","subtitle":"Adrián Bolonio","socialImage":"/media/adrian.jpg"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/event/","slug":"/posts/2019-JUN"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-06-26","description":"A high incidence of dyslexic traits are found in computer programmers. These special traits and abilities are commonly depicted as disabilities. In the same vein, one-fifth of the estimated global population possesses disabilities. Join me as we deploy the narratives that exist at the intersection of ability and access. Let’s steer the strengths, park the misconceptions, and drive hacks meant to empower programmers who exhibit special traits and abilities.","category":"Event","title":"What's Dyslexia Got To Do With It","subtitle":"Jeannette Washington","socialImage":"/media/jeannette.jpg"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"Event","currentPage":3,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":12,"prevPagePath":"/category/event/page/2","nextPagePath":"/category/event/page/4","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","608223278"]}
