##About A11yTalks
- A11yTalks was started in May 2017 by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cariefisher">Carie Fisher</a> to help bridge the gap between developers and accessibility professionals. Not long after, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dbungard">Donna Bungard</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/volkswagenchick">AmyJune Hineline</a> joined the team and really helped this project get off the ground! We'd like to give a special shout-out to <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/caitlinthefirst">Caitlin Cashin</a> who has moderated some past panels as well.
- A11yTalks seeks to provide a friendly, safe environment. All participants should be able to engage in productive dialogue. They should share and learn with each other in an atmosphere of mutual respect. We require all participants to adhere to our <a href="/pages/conduct">Code of Conduct</a>. This applies to all community interaction and events.
- We also make a conscious effort to include PWD, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, women, and other marginalized groups in tech in our speaker line-up. Please let us know if you have ideas on how to make A11yTalks more friendly to all!

##Speaking Engagement Details
- Based on the information you provide to us (see below), we will create a flyer for advertising purposes. You will be shown the flyer before it is public and can suggest edits. Once approved, we will post this in various places in the community and on LinkedIn and Twitter.
- We are using Zoom for our virtual meetings, which is live-stream to our YouTube channel. This live-stream will be converted to a video and posted to our channel archives. We are using a Creative Commons license, so you own your content, but you agree to let us post your content on your behalf.
- Before speaking, we offer practice time to get used to the technology. This is optional, but we do need you to report to the room *10-15 minutes before your talk* to test the audio/video and fix any last-minute technical issues. You are not required to share your video.
- Typically, the speaker(s) is introduced by one of the hosts, the presenter/panelist speaks for 45 minutes or less, Q&A time from the audience, general wrap-up.
- Note: we do offer AI generated live-captions during the event and manually edit the YouTube captions for the video post-event, for our hearing impaired audience members. We highly encourage our speakers to describe any visuals used during their presentation and to provide links to resources and slides, for our visually impaired audience members.
 
##What We Need From You
- First, we need to decide what month/day/time is open for you to present. We aim for mid-month, mid-week, mid-day (ET) to cover more time zones, but we can certainly be flexible!
- Next, we need a title and a short description (3-4 sentences) of your presentation. If you have presented the talk before and you have a link to that event, that can be helpful.
- If you have links in your presentation, please provide them as a separate file. This helps us with link accuracy during the event.
- Headshot/avatar image of yourself
- Pronouns
- Twitter, LinkedIn, or other way people can easily contact you directly
- Lastly, please provide us a "fun fact" or two that you'd like to share with the group so people can get to know you a bit better!
