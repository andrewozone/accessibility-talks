Accessibility is often segmented off, but a solid accessible strategy touches many areas of the website lifecycle. In fact, it is one of the cornerstones of a good user experience. In this discussion, you will hear from two accessibility experts in pursuit of true Universal Design – bringing both a visual and a non-visual perspective.

- We’ll discuss the crossroads where UX & Accessibility meet
- Build an understanding what design concepts mean for JAWS & Braille
- Review Universal Design is & what it means to the non-visual user
- Provide an actionable "Top 10 List" of easy tips for every designer

This accessibility and UX discussion is practical, inclusive, and actionable.
