In other words, we want our web app to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for the user. But a lot of times we don’t think about the user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments. Adrián will show us some testing tools, libraries, and techniques to increase the a11y test coverage of our code with a simple React application example."}}},{"node":{"id":"375cb696-3cda-5f04-81b0-91b4476917b5","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-JUN","categorySlug":"/category/event/"},"frontmatter":{"socialImage":"/media/jeannette.jpg","title":"What's Dyslexia Got To Do With It","subtitle":"Jeannette Washington","date":"2019-06-26","description":"A high incidence of dyslexic traits are found in computer programmers. These special traits and abilities are commonly depicted as disabilities. In the same vein, one-fifth of the estimated global population possesses disabilities.

We live in the world where our devices are able to simultaneously operate with tons of data. Tweets, notifications, alert messages, progress bars — all these components appear on the web page asynchronously, which makes the user experience more convenient than ever."}}},{"node":{"id":"39ccb56e-3c5f-54f5-8d76-16fb94497cad","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-MAY-panel","categorySlug":"/category/panel/"},"frontmatter":{"socialImage":"/photo.png","title":"Traditional CMS vs. Headless CMS A11y Throwdown!","subtitle":"Panel","date":"2019-05-09","description":"Join us for a live discussion of how accessibility is impacted by using a traditional CMS vs. a headless CMS and what are the pros/cons of each when it comes to creating accessible sites and applications.
