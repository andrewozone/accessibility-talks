In fact, it is one of the cornerstones of good user experience. In this discussion you will hear from two accessibility experts in pursuit of true Universal Design – bringing both a visual and a non-visual perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll discuss the crossroads where UX &amp;#x26; Accessibility meet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build an understanding what design concepts mean for JAWS &amp;#x26; Braille&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Universal Design is &amp;#x26; what it means to the non-visual user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide an actionable “Top 10 List” of easy tips for every designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accessibility and UX discussion is practical, inclusive, and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating user stories and a brand that are inclusive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a content strategy and plan for an accessible presence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare your media to reach a broader audience and more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing should be fun and accessibility should be easy: let’s try to breathe that into both of these to meet your needs in a more organic way.&lt;/p&gt;

From unit testing to marketing, it all affects trust. The trust between teams and team members, employees and managers, companies and customers will play a part in your success. Building and maintaining trust requires intention and dedication. And if you’ve lost it, it’s hard to get back. I’ll share what I’ve learned by studying accessibility and inclusion as a web developer. I’ll talk about the strategies and tactics teams can use to create long-lasting positive relationships with users. We’ll also look at some pitfalls to avoid. Join me if you like the idea of a web you can trust.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems by trying to be digitally inclusive and help individuals and groups to access and use information and communication technologies - what we've really done is make it harder.

In other words, we want our web app to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for the user. But a lot of times we don’t think about the user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web accessibility (a11y) means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools and that they can contribute equally without barriers.” (Source: W3C - Web Accessibility Initiative). Our role as frontend and web developers is to create clear interfaces to make people understand and care about data, independently of their disabilities or impairments, but what we, developers, often forget is to ensure that the code we write follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and the only way to achieve that is testing, either manual or automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated web a11y tests can free up our QA team from manual testing every part of our application…but…they can’t automatically, and magically, make our site accessible. We should use automated accessibility tests as one step of a larger testing process. Remember that only 20% to 50% of all accessibility issues can automatically be detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrián will show us some testing tools, libraries, and techniques to increase the a11y test coverage of our code with a simple React application example.&lt;/p&gt;
