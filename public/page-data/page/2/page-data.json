In Sara's time at Code and Theory, she has seen an accessibility awakening with not internally but also with clients. Accessibility deliverables are a clear value-add proposition to our clients, including creative technology and technical strategy integrations. Sara will be discussing how she has built an actionable awareness over multiple teams about accessible deliverables - from answering RFPs through QA and final launch. Sara will also be discussing the range of needs her clients are requesting when theyâ€™re building their digital products. Finally, Sara will be discussing current needs within the agency regarding scaling skillsets, capacity planning, and follow-the-sun development/test strategy."}}},{"node":{"id":"42c45e61-b035-5408-a16f-43e2bfaaee04","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-SEP","categorySlug":"/category/panel/"},"frontmatter":{"socialImage":"/photo.png","title":"Digital Inclusion - What?

Pages *with* ARIA actually have 65% more issues than those without. So what is going on?\nIt seems by trying to be digitally inclusive and help individuals and groups to access and use information and communication technologies - what we've really done is make it harder. So what can we do about it? Who does digital inclusion effect anyway? And why is it important? Join us for a panel discussion on this complex topic!"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"currentPage":2,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":8,"prevPagePath":"/page/1","nextPagePath":"/page/3","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","608223278"]}
