Adrián will show us some testing tools, libraries, and techniques to increase the a11y test coverage of our code with a simple React application example.","socialImage":"/media/adrian.jpg"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-JUN","categorySlug":"/category/event/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What's Dyslexia Got To Do With It","subtitle":"Jeannette Washington","date":"2019-06-26","description":"A high incidence of dyslexic traits are found in computer programmers.
