From unit testing to marketing, it all affects trust. The trust between teams and team members, employees and managers, companies and customers will play a part in your success. Building and maintaining trust requires intention and dedication. And if you’ve lost it, it’s hard to get back. I’ll share what I’ve learned by studying accessibility and inclusion as a web developer. I’ll talk about the strategies and tactics teams can use to create long-lasting positive relationships with users. We’ll also look at some pitfalls to avoid.

In other words, we want our web app to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for the user. But a lot of times we don’t think about the user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web accessibility (a11y) means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools and that they can contribute equally without barriers.” (Source: W3C - Web Accessibility Initiative). Our role as frontend and web developers is to create clear interfaces to make people understand and care about data, independently of their disabilities or impairments, but what we, developers, often forget is to ensure that the code we write follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and the only way to achieve that is testing, either manual or automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated web a11y tests can free up our QA team from manual testing every part of our application…but…they can’t automatically, and magically, make our site accessible. We should use automated accessibility tests as one step of a larger testing process. Remember that only 20% to 50% of all accessibility issues can automatically be detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrián will show us some testing tools, libraries, and techniques to increase the a11y test coverage of our code with a simple React application example.&lt;/p&gt;

Catharine McNally happened upon the “Closed Captioning” icon just minutes before a company-wide meeting at Phase2 Technology. Raising her hand for her colleagues to ‘turn on’ the button, and what followed was a riveting display of speed and accuracy of dialogue across speakers in multiple rooms between Washington, DC, Portland, Oregon, and New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone was truly excited about the captioning and the possibilities that may follow: transcriptions for notes, more equal access, and the ability to search for captions for bits of meeting notes. The best part was it was ‘ready’ out of the box for users of Google Slides and compatible for display within the Zoom and/or BlueJeans platform. Since then, reports of similarly positive experiences have cropped up for live-captioning for Skype and Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;
