Finally, we'll touch on some areas where even the best current implementations still fall short, and where things could go in the future.","socialImage":"/media/sarah.png"}}}]},"file":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/b7e0ab35174517513faa46e0309ac69d/32198/mike.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"tag":"2020","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/2020","nextPagePath":"/tag/2020/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","608223278"]}
