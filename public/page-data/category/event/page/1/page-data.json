But what we don't often talk about is what it really means to be accessible - how do we ensure we are including everyone and empowering every user in every scenario to use our sites, products, and devices? Are we including trans folks? Parents? The chronically ill? People with limited literacy? The injured? If you're wondering how these folks might be affected by accessibility and you want your website to be inclusive for everyone, this is the session for you.","category":"Event","title":"Beyond the Screen Reader - Humanizing Accessibility","subtitle":"Alanna Burke","socialImage":"/media/alanna.jpg"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/event/","slug":"/posts/2020-JAN"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-01-29","description":"There has never been a better time to consider how your skills can be harnessed within the tech industry.

In Sara's time at Code and Theory, she has seen an accessibility awakening with not internally but also with clients. Accessibility deliverables are a clear value-add proposition to our clients, including creative technology and technical strategy integrations. Sara will be discussing how she has built an actionable awareness over multiple teams about accessible deliverables - from answering RFPs through QA and final launch. Sara will also be discussing the range of needs her clients are requesting when they’re building their digital products. Finally, Sara will be discussing current needs within the agency regarding scaling skillsets, capacity planning, and follow-the-sun development/test strategy.","category":"Event","title":"Accessibility in the Modern Digital Agency","subtitle":"Sara Tabor","socialImage":"/media/sara.jpg"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"Event","currentPage":1,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":4,"prevPagePath":"/category/event","nextPagePath":"/category/event/page/2","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","608223278"]}
