This presentation will take a look at when and how to use different types of live regions, some alternative possibilities, and how to debug problems as they arise. Finally, we'll touch on some areas where even the best current implementations still fall short, and where things could go in the future.","socialImage":"/media/sarah.png"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-JUN","categorySlug":"/category/event/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Accessible Game Design - Itâ€™s 2 Point 1 fun!","subtitle":"Cyndi Wiley","date":"2020-06-17","description":"Long before we crushed tiny candies on our screens, dice games were among some of the first known to be played as far back as 5000 BCE.
