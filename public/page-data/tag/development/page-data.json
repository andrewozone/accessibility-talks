How do you make toast notifications noticeable for someone using screen magnification? Why does this one error message refuse to work with VoiceOver, even though it's fine with NVDA? This presentation will take a look at when and how to use different types of live regions, some alternative possibilities, and how to debug problems as they arise. Finally, we'll touch on some areas where even the best current implementations still fall short, and where things could go in the future.","socialImage":"/media/sarah.png"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-MAY","categorySlug":"/category/event/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A11y Axioms - What are the basic truths about accessibility?
