The theory of play is a well-researched area with roots in anthropology and psychology. Games have emerged throughout human history as an expression of play. Accessible game design is an area that has not been as well researched. In this presentation, you will learn how to get started checking games for accessibility using WCAG 2.1 standards, and how to get started designing your own games."}}},{"node":{"id":"ebd9c9a3-cb16-5090-8640-f08494eeb8d1","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-MAY","categorySlug":"/category/event/"},"frontmatter":{"socialImage":"/media/mike.jpg","title":"A11y Axioms - What Are the Basic Truths About Accessibility?","subtitle":"Mike Gifford","date":"2020-05-28","description":"Mike wanted to do some basic modeling for accessibility and realized the need to simplify things.

But what we don't often talk about is what it really means to be accessible - how do we ensure we are including everyone and empowering every user in every scenario to use our sites, products, and devices? Are we including trans folks? Parents? The chronically ill? People with limited literacy? The injured? If you're wondering how these folks might be affected by accessibility and you want your website to be inclusive for everyone, this is the session for you."}}},{"node":{"id":"5aef1723-3960-561c-a55b-eface99abaa1","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-JAN","categorySlug":"/category/event/"},"frontmatter":{"socialImage":"/media/jeannette.jpg","title":"Why Dyslexic Narratives Matter in Tech","subtitle":"Jeannette Washington","date":"2020-01-29","description":"There has never been a better time to consider how your skills can be harnessed within the tech industry.
