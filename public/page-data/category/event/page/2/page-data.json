They can be intimidating when starting out, and frustrating for those who regularly deal with them. Do you really need a live region for that combobox? How do you make toast notifications noticeable for someone using screen magnification? Why does this one error message refuse to work with VoiceOver, even though it's fine with NVDA? This presentation will take a look at when and how to use different types of live regions, some alternative possibilities, and how to debug problems as they arise. Finally, we'll touch on some areas where even the best current implementations still fall short, and where things could go in the future.","category":"Event","title":"The Many Lives of a Notification","subtitle":"Sarah Higley","socialImage":"/media/sarah.png"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/event/","slug":"/posts/2020-JUN"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-06-17","description":"Long before we crushed tiny candies on our screens, dice games were among some of the first known to be played as far back as 5000 BCE. The theory of play is a well-researched area with roots in anthropology and psychology. Games have emerged throughout human history as an expression of play. Accessible game design is an area that has not been as well researched. In this presentation, you will learn how to get started checking games for accessibility using WCAG 2.1 standards, and how to get started designing your own games.","category":"Event","title":"Accessible Game Design - It’s 2 Point 1 fun!","subtitle":"Cyndi Wiley","socialImage":"/media/cyndi.jpg"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/event/","slug":"/posts/2020-MAY"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-05-28","description":"Mike wanted to do some basic modeling for accessibility and realized the need to simplify things.

This session will cover some of those approaches, and conclude with a Q&A at the end to see if we can’t make them better.","category":"Event","title":"A11y Axioms - What Are the Basic Truths About Accessibility?","subtitle":"Mike Gifford","socialImage":"/media/mike.jpg"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/event/","slug":"/posts/2020-APR"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-04-22","description":"It seems that everyone has a message or opinion to share in the age of COVID-19.
