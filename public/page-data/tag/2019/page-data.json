In Sara's time at Code and Theory, she has seen an accessibility awakening with not internally but also with clients. Accessibility deliverables are a clear value-add proposition to our clients, including creative technology and technical strategy integrations. Sara will be discussing how she has built an actionable awareness over multiple teams about accessible deliverables - from answering RFPs through QA and final launch. Sara will also be discussing the range of needs her clients are requesting when they’re building their digital products. Finally, Sara will be discussing current needs within the agency regarding scaling skillsets, capacity planning, and follow-the-sun development/test strategy.","socialImage":"/media/sara.jpg"}}}]},"file":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/b7e0ab35174517513faa46e0309ac69d/32198/mike.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"tag":"2019","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/2019","nextPagePath":"/tag/2019/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","608223278"]}
