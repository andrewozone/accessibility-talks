Pages *with* ARIA actually have 65% more issues than those without. So what is going on?\nIt seems by trying to be digitally inclusive and help individuals and groups to access and use information and communication technologies - what we've really done is make it harder. So what can we do about it? Who does digital inclusion effect anyway? And why is it important?

In other words, we want our web app to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for the user. But a lot of times we don’t think about the user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments. Adrián will show us some testing tools, libraries, and techniques to increase the a11y test coverage of our code with a simple React application example."}}},{"node":{"id":"375cb696-3cda-5f04-81b0-91b4476917b5","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-JUN","categorySlug":"/category/event/"},"frontmatter":{"socialImage":"/media/jeannette.jpg","title":"What's Dyslexia Got To Do With It","subtitle":"Jeannette Washington","date":"2019-06-26","category":"Event","description":"A high incidence of dyslexic traits are found in computer programmers. These special traits and abilities are commonly depicted as disabilities. In the same vein, one-fifth of the estimated global population possesses disabilities.
