The theory of play is a well-researched area with roots in anthropology and psychology. Games have emerged throughout human history as an expression of play. Accessible game design is an area that has not been as well researched. In this presentation, you will learn how to get started checking games for accessibility using WCAG 2.1 standards, and how to get started designing your own games.","socialImage":"/media/cyndi.jpg"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-MAY","categorySlug":"/category/event/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A11y Axioms - What Are the Basic Truths About Accessibility?","subtitle":"Mike Gifford","date":"2020-05-28","category":"Event","description":"Mike wanted to do some basic modeling for accessibility and realized the need to simplify things. This is how the A11yAxiom project got started on Twitter. He wanted to define some essential truths in order to help people get a better sense of how to approach digital accessibility.

In other words, we want our web app to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for the user. But a lot of times we don’t think about the user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments. Adrián will show us some testing tools, libraries, and techniques to increase the a11y test coverage of our code with a simple React application example.","socialImage":"/media/adrian.jpg"}}}]},"file":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/b7e0ab35174517513faa46e0309ac69d/32198/mike.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"tag":"WCAG","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/wcag","nextPagePath":"/tag/wcag/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","608223278"]}
