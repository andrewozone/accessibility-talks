This is how the A11yAxiom project got started on Twitter. He wanted to define some essential truths in order to help people get a better sense of how to approach digital accessibility. This session will cover some of those approaches, and conclude with a Q&A at the end to see if we canâ€™t make them better."}}},{"node":{"id":"1cf8c9c9-28b8-555e-8554-c50c19f21ae5","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-APR","categorySlug":"/category/event/"},"frontmatter":{"socialImage":"/media/imelda.jpg","title":"Digital Communication in the Age of COVID-19","subtitle":"Imelda March","date":"2020-04-22","category":"Event","description":"It seems that everyone has a message or opinion to share in the age of COVID-19.

But what we don't often talk about is what it really means to be accessible - how do we ensure we are including everyone and empowering every user in every scenario to use our sites, products, and devices?

If you're wondering how these folks might be affected by accessibility and you want your website to be inclusive for everyone, this is the session for you."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"currentPage":1,"postsLimit":3,"postsOffset":3,"prevPagePath":"/","nextPagePath":"/page/2","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","2644362409","401334301"]}
