In Sara's time at Code and Theory, she has seen an accessibility awakening with not internally but also with clients. Accessibility deliverables are a clear value-add proposition to our clients, including creative technology and technical strategy integrations. Sara will be discussing how she has built an actionable awareness over multiple teams about accessible deliverables - from answering RFPs through QA and final launch. Sara will also be discussing the range of needs her clients are requesting when theyâ€™re building their digital products. Finally, Sara will be discussing current needs within the agency regarding scaling skillsets, capacity planning, and follow-the-sun development/test strategy."}}},{"node":{"id":"42c45e61-b035-5408-a16f-43e2bfaaee04","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-SEP","categorySlug":"/category/panel/"},"frontmatter":{"socialImage":"/photo.png","title":"Digital Inclusion - What?
