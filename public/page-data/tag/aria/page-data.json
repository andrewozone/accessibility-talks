This presentation will take a look at when and how to use different types of live regions, some alternative possibilities, and how to debug problems as they arise. Finally, we'll touch on some areas where even the best current implementations still fall short, and where things could go in the future.","socialImage":"/media/sarah.png"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-DEC","categorySlug":"/category/panel/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"“Accessibility is too hard” - Developer Edition","subtitle":"Panel","date":"2019-12-13","description":"In this panel, we’ll dig into people’s misconceptions about the difficulty of accessibility as well as some of the ways that accessibility is genuinely difficult.
