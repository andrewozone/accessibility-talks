They can be intimidating when starting out, and frustrating for those who regularly deal with them. Do you really need a live region for that combobox? How do you make toast notifications noticeable for someone using screen magnification? Why does this one error message refuse to work with VoiceOver, even though it's fine with NVDA? This presentation will take a look at when and how to use different types of live regions, some alternative possibilities, and how to debug problems as they arise. Finally, we'll touch on some areas where even the best current implementations still fall short, and where things could go in the future.","socialImage":"/media/sarah.png"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-FEB","categorySlug":"/category/event/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Beyond the Screen Reader - Humanizing Accessibility","subtitle":"Alanna Burke","date":"2020-02-20","description":"When we talk about accessibility, we talk a lot about the technical bits, the alphabet soup - WCAG, AAA, WAI-ARIA, Screen readers.

Are we including trans folks? Parents? The chronically ill? People with limited literacy? The injured? If you're wondering how these folks might be affected by accessibility and you want your website to be inclusive for everyone, this is the session for you.","socialImage":"/media/alanna.jpg"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-JAN","categorySlug":"/category/event/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why Dyslexic Narratives Matter in Tech","subtitle":"Jeannette Washington","date":"2020-01-29","description":"There has never been a better time to consider how your skills can be harnessed within the tech industry.
