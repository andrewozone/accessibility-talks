In Sara's time at Code and Theory, she has seen an accessibility awakening with not internally but also with clients. Accessibility deliverables are a clear value-add proposition to our clients, including creative technology and technical strategy integrations. Sara will be discussing how she has built an actionable awareness over multiple teams about accessible deliverables - from answering RFPs through QA and final launch. Sara will also be discussing the range of needs her clients are requesting when they’re building their digital products. Finally, Sara will be discussing current needs within the agency regarding scaling skillsets, capacity planning, and follow-the-sun development/test strategy."}}},{"node":{"id":"42c45e61-b035-5408-a16f-43e2bfaaee04","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-SEP","categorySlug":"/category/panel/"},"frontmatter":{"socialImage":"/photo.png","title":"Digital Inclusion - What?

Pages *with* ARIA actually have 65% more issues than those without. So what is going on?\nIt seems by trying to be digitally inclusive and help individuals and groups to access and use information and communication technologies - what we've really done is make it harder. So what can we do about it? Who does digital inclusion effect anyway? And why is it important?
