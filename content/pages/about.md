##About A11yTalks
- A11yTalks was started in May 2017 by Carie Fisher to help bridge the gap between developers and accessibility professionals. Not long after, Donna Bungard and AmyJune Hineline joined the team!
- A11yTalks seeks to provide a friendly, safe environment. All participants should be able to engage in productive dialogue. They should share and learn with each other in an atmosphere of mutual respect. We require all participants to adhere to this Code of Conduct. This applies to all community interaction and events.
- We also make a conscious effort to include PWD, POC, LGBTQ, women, and other marginalized groups in tech in our speaker line-up. Please let us know if you have ideas on how to make A11yTalks more friendly to all!

##Speaking engagement details
- Based on the information you provide to us (see below), we will create a flyer for advertising purposes. You will be shown the flyer before it is public and can suggest edits. Once approved, we will post this in various places in the community and on Twitter.
- Currently, we are using Zoom for our virtual meetings but the audience will see it streamed live on our YouTube channel. - Before speaking, we offer practice time to get used to the technology. This is optional, but we do need you to report to the room 10-15 minutes before your talk is scheduled to test the audio/video and fix any last-minute technical issues. You are not required to use video if you prefer not to.
- The format typically is: the speaker(s) is introduced by one of the hosts, the presenter/panelist speaks for 45 minutes or less, Q&A time from the audience, general wrap-up. On average, we have around 20-50 live participants for each event, but each video garners 100+ views (depending on the topic/speaker).
- After the live event has concluded, it will be posted to our YouTube channel, and captions and any links from the talk will be added. We are using a Creative Commons license, so you own your content, but you agree to let us post your content on your behalf. Live events are saved automatically to our YouTube channel.
 
##What we need from you
- First, we need to decide what month/day/time is open for you to present. We aim for mid-month, mid-week, mid-day (ET) to cover more time zones, but we can certainly be flexible!
- Next, we need a title and a short description (3-4 sentences) of your presentation. If you have presented the talk before and you have a link to that event, that can be helpful.
- If you have links in your presentation, please provide them as a separate file. This helps us with link accuracy during the event.
- Headshot/avatar image of yourself
- Pronouns
- Twitter, LinkedIn, or other way people can easily contact you directly
