In Sara's time at Code and Theory, she has seen an accessibility awakening with not internally but also with clients. Accessibility deliverables are a clear value-add proposition to our clients, including creative technology and technical strategy integrations. Sara will be discussing how she has built an actionable awareness over multiple teams about accessible deliverables - from answering RFPs through QA and final launch. Sara will also be discussing the range of needs her clients are requesting when theyâ€™re building their digital products. Finally, Sara will be discussing current needs within the agency regarding scaling skillsets, capacity planning, and follow-the-sun development/test strategy.","category":"Event","title":"Accessibility in the Modern Digital Agency","subtitle":"Sara Tabor","socialImage":"/media/sara.jpg"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"Event","currentPage":2,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":8,"prevPagePath":"/category/event/page/1","nextPagePath":"/category/event/page/3","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","608223278"]}
