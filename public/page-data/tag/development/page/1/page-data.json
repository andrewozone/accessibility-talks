But what we don't often talk about is what it really means to be accessible - how do we ensure we are including everyone and empowering every user in every scenario to use our sites, products, and devices? Are we including trans folks? Parents? The chronically ill? People with limited literacy? The injured? If you're wondering how these folks might be affected by accessibility and you want your website to be inclusive for everyone, this is the session for you.","socialImage":"/media/alanna.jpg"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-JAN","categorySlug":"/category/event/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why Dyslexic Narratives Matter in Tech","subtitle":"Jeannette Washington","date":"2020-01-29","description":"There has never been a better time to consider how your skills can be harnessed within the tech industry.

In other words, we want our web app to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for the user. But a lot of times we don’t think about the user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments. Adrián will show us some testing tools, libraries, and techniques to increase the a11y test coverage of our code with a simple React application example.","socialImage":"/media/adrian.jpg"}}}]},"file":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/b7e0ab35174517513faa46e0309ac69d/32198/mike.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Development","currentPage":1,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":4,"prevPagePath":"/tag/development","nextPagePath":"/tag/development/page/2","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","608223278"]}
